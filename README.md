# Hello-World

Hello, Earth!

Has been a while since I've just left the planet and I'm out in space to train our spacial monkeys to be able for them to contribute saving our beloved planet.
But I have a problem: I ran out of bananas, and here on other planets is just impossible to get them...
Could you please send me more? Here the coordinates: +/-6876316805488WR , -841002545235GH, +54784110054A2.
